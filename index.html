                        <h2>Quartz Mountain</h2>

                        <p>Overview: The hike out to Quartz Mountain is fun, you can vary the length and difficulty of
                            your hike by
                            which trails you choose. Its great for any hiking fitness level. From picnickers and novice
                            hikers, to
                            seasoned hikers breaking in equipment or wanting an area mostly used by foot traffic.</p>

                        <p> Its also a great place to take the family, especially to find a cooler place to head in the
                            summer time.
                            Hike in for a picnic. Kids will love to run around these trails.</p>

                        <p>
                            The views from the top of Quartz Mountain are as spectacular as from the top of Mt. Spokane,
                            with the
                            added satisfaction that you made it up there under your own power.</p>

                        <p> Mt. Spokane is a fee area, a Washington State Parks Discover Pass is required - $30 annual
                            or $10 for
                            single day use. The State Parks no longer receive any of your tax dollars, their operations
                            are financed by
                            fees. Don't be a cheapskate, get a Discover Pass. This includes just driving into the parks,
                            for example to
                            drive to the top of Mt. Spokane. There is a $99 fine for not having a Discover Pass.</p>

                        <p> For GPS navigation to the trail head, the coordinates are: 47.90323, -117.10005</p>

                        <p> Tips: If using the phone App: Go online for web links to maps & resources, trail video, and
                            360º panorama
                            interactive photos. www.everytrail.com</p>

                        <p> As always, pack out what you take in. Keep noise down so not to disturb wildlife. Keep an
                            eye out for
                            wildlife, I came across a moose, but I was there on a quiet day early in the hiking
                            season.</p>

                        <p> Wear proper footwear, tennis shoes will suffice for this hike. Bring bug spray for the top
                            of Quartz
                            Mountain.</p>

                        <p> Respect the privacy of the people who have rented the Fire Lookout. Most likely it will be
                            rented the day
                            you are up there. Do not climb up on the Fire Lookout itself, as it has been rented.</p>

                        <p>
                            FYI - Dogs are restricted to be leashed at the Mount Spokane State Park, you can get a $75
                            fine for not
                            having your dog leashed. There are moose on Mt. Spokane, you don't need the dog pissing off
                            a moose! You
                            probably don't want to know the fine and potential jail time penalties for you dog chasing
                            wildlife.</p>

                        <h2>Big Rock</h2>

                        <p> The Rocks of Sharon call to hikers and climbers alike, large granitic monoliths rising up
                            from a ridgeline surrounded by a rich ecosystem and prime wildlife habitat. From the rocks,
                            hikers can enjoy views south over the Palouse to Steptoe Butte and north over the Spokane
                            Valley and Mount Spokane. "Big Rock" is exactly that: a gigantic rock extending 230 feet
                            from the ground surface that is visible for several miles. If you are lucky enough to
                            experience this place in solitude while the fog rolls off the valley, Big Rock will take on
                            an otherworldly feel that you will not soon forget.

                            From the Steven's Creek parking lot, head up the road to the right. Follow the old road for
                            a bit less than half a mile to where you reach an opening. Take the winding path to the
                            right. Enjoy the gentle switchbacks that WTA helped replace the brutal path that used to cut
                            straight up the hill.

                            As you climb, looks for signs of the local moose that roam Dishman Hills. After roughly
                            three-quarters of a mile, you will reach the base of Rocks of Sharon. The valley views and
                            geological details of the rocks make this a great spot to sit and take it all in. Or you can
                            make a larger loop by continuing on the Iller Creek Trail to the Upper Valley Trail, which
                            bisects the Iller Creek Loop after another one-third of a mile. This option makes a rough
                            lollipop loop and adds a little more than a mile to your roundtrip distance.</p>

                        <h2>Northwest Rim of the Bruneau River</h2>

                        <h6>Overview: This Wilderness was primarily established to protect "whitewater" rafting recreation. However, there are a lot of scenic views of the canyon from the rims and a few hiking trails into the canyon.</h6>

                        <p>   The United States Congress designated the Bruneau-Jarbidge Rivers Wilderness in 2009 and it now has a total of 89,777 acres. All of this wilderness is located in Idaho and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management.</p>

                        <p>   Description
                            This wilderness has some of the best class V whitewater that Idaho has to offer. The Jarbidge River offers a remote and challenging 29-mile float trip taking boaters through a maze of spectacular canyons, "hoo-doo" rock spires, junipers and red volcanic cliffs.

                            The Bruneau River flows north from headwaters in the northern Nevada mountains and is known for its sheer-walled, rocky canyons and whitewater boating opportunities. The 50-mile long Bruneau River begins at the confluence of the Jarbidge River and the West Fork Bruneau River.

                            In the wilderness, plateaus are divided by deep, winding river canyons and provide habitats for bighorn sheep, redband trout, deer, cougar, coyotes, bobcats and river otters.

                            Tips: This area is isolated and no services are available. Anything you might need should be brought with you. There is intermittent cell phone service and the area is not regularly patrolled by law enforcement. You are on your own!

                            The map shows four access roads into the area. The one at Bruneau, Idaho is paved to the Bruneau River Bridge. The other three roads, all starting from Hwy #51 are crowned and graveled until nearing the Bruneau River.

                            The roads (all dirt) in the southern part of this guide and especially the ones leading to the overlooks are bad. DON'T GO IF IT IS WET!

                            Another caution: There are several roads shown on topo maps and BLM maps of this area that just don't exist. The roads in this guide do.

                            There are no developed campgrounds in the area. Primitive camping is allowed.

                            The best times to visit the area are in late fall and in early spring. It gets hot in summer time and winter usually brings snow. The snakes are out in late spring and are starting to den in early fall. This is great rattlesnake habitat. Be careful!

                            The links to BLM websites in the POIs are notorious for not being accessible.

                            Contact info for Bureau of Land Management for maps, fire info, ect.:</p>

                        <h2>Jump Creek - Sands Basin</h2>

                        <h6> Overview: Jump Creek has a spectacular 60' waterfall. It originates in Sands Basin from year around springs. An awesome canyon with colorful rock walls towering hundreds of feet tall line its banks.</h6>

                        <p>    The Jump Creek Recreation Area is a DAY USE ONLY site. The trail head has several fire rings and sites for picnics. It is accessible by automobile. The falls are an easy ten minute hike from the trail head.</p>

                        <p>    There is a waterfall in Poison Creek. It will require hiking and serious rock climbing to get a good view.

                            Sands Basin is home to a herd of wild mustangs.

                            The parking areas, trail head, and trails have been recently renovated and all are in good condition.

                            The area is popular with hikers, sightseers, horse backers, geocachers, photographers, and ATV/Offroaders. The hiking trails are off limits to motorized vehicles.

                            There is a restroom at the trail head but no potable water.

                            Tips: From Marsing, Idaho take Idaho 55 west to the junction with US-95. Continue 1½ miles west past the junction and turn left (west) onto Cemetery Road. Turn left (south) at the T-intersection with a STOP sign. This road is Jump Creek Road. Continue south until the pavement ends and the road curves right over a cattle guard. The road is public, but the land on each side is private until reaching the recreation area.

                            From Homedale, Idaho take US 95 south to Jump Creek Road, turn right (south) and follow Jump Creek Road to the trail head.

                            The water flow is higher in the spring, but the area is accessible all year in good weather. Dress appropriately for the weather.

                            Bring anything you need, including water and firewood. It is recommended that you have a high clearance vehicle to travel to Sands Basin.

                            Be on the lookout for rattlesnakes and for poison ivy along Jump Creek.</p>

        <h3>TEN THINGS YOU SHOULD BRING ON EVERY HIKE</h3>

        <p> 1. Appropriate footwear. For a short day hike that doesn’t involve a heavy pack or technical terrain, trail
            shoes are great. For longer hikes, carrying heavier loads, or more technical terrain, hiking boots offer
            more support.</p>

        <p> 2. Map and compass/GPS. A map and compass not only tell you where you are and how far you have to go, it can
            help you find campsites, water, and an emergency exit route in case of an accident. While GPS units are very
            useful, always carry a map and compass as a backup.</p>

        <p> 3. Extra water and a way to purify it. Without enough water, your body’s muscles and organs simply can’t
            perform as well. Consuming too little water will not only make you thirsty, but susceptible to hypothermia
            and altitude sickness.</p>

        <p> 4. Extra food. Any number of things could keep you out longer than expected: getting lost, enjoying time by
            a stream, an injury, or difficult terrain. Extra food will help keep up energy and morale.</p>

        <p> 5. Rain gear and extra clothing. Because the weatherman is not always right. Dressing in layers allows you
            to adjust to changing weather and activity levels. Two rules: avoid cotton (it keeps moisture close to your
            skin) and always carry a hat.</p>

        <p> 6. Safety items: fire, light, and a whistle. The warmth of a fire and a hot drink can help prevent
            hypothermia. Fires are also a great way to signal for help if you get lost. If lost, you’ll also want the
            whistle as it is more effective than using your voice to call for help (use 3 short bursts). And just in
            case you’re out later than planned, a flashlight/headlamp is a must-have item to see your map and where
            you’re walking.</p>

        <p> 7. First aid kit. Prepackaged first-aid kits for hikers are available at any outfitter. Double your
            effectiveness with knowledge: take a first-aid class with the American Red Cross or a Wilderness First Aid
            class.</p>

        <p> 8. Knife or multi-purpose tool. These enable you to cut strips of cloth into bandages, remove splinters, fix
            broken eyeglasses, and perform a whole host of repairs on malfunctioning gear.</p>

        <p> 9. Sun screen and sun glasses. Especially above treeline when there is a skin-scorching combination of sun
            and snow, you’ll need sunglasses to prevent snow blindness and sunscreen to prevent sunburn.</p>

        <p> 10. Daypack/backpack. You’ll want something you can carry comfortably and has the features designed to keep
            you hiking smartly. Don’t forget the rain cover; some packs come with one built-in. Keep the other
            Essentials in the pack and you’ll always be ready to hit the trail safely.</p>
